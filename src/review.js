        <p>Dragon Ball Super: Broly faces a tall task. It's a new Dragon Ball film that acts as a canonical continuation of Dragon Ball Super is very much a big deal, but it's also a movie that focuses on the controversial Broly, an overpowered character who has had three other Dragon Ball films devoted to him, much to viewers' delight or chagrin. If this film didn't stick the landing it wouldn't have the luxury of a new episode on television next week to cleanse the palate.</p>
